# Snake Game using Python and Tkinter

This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game aims to recreate the popular arcade game where the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.

## Key Features:

### 1. User Interface: 
The game features a graphical user interface created with Tkinter, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience. The UI includes main menu, gameplay screen, and game over screen with labels, buttons, and graphics.

### 2. Snake Movement and Food Generation: 
The snake's movement is controlled by the user through key inputs, enabling it to navigate in different directions on the game grid. Food items are randomly generated for the snake to consume, increasing its length and score.

### 3. Collision Detection and Game Logic: 
The game incorporates collision detection mechanisms to detect if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries, resulting in game over. The logic handles scoring, game over scenarios, and allows for restarting the game.

### 4. Score Tracking and High Scores: 
A scoring system tracks the player's score during the game. Additionally, the game includes a high scores feature that stores and displays the highest scores achieved by players, fostering competitiveness and replay value.
